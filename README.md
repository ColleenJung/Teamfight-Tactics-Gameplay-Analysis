# Teamfight-Tactics-Gameplay-Analysis


## Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of gameplay data from Teamfight Tactics (TFT), an auto battler game developed by Riot Games. Our focus is on extracting insights into winning strategies and understanding game balance.

## Team Members
- Andy Li
- Colleen Jung
- Maya Mireles Rios

## Dataset
Our dataset includes detailed endgame statistics from Set 8 of TFT, specifically from the top-tier player segments (Challenger and Grandmaster ranks) in the North American region. It comprises 2,296 records from Challenger-ranked matches and 6,392 records from Grandmaster-ranked games.


## Objectives
- To develop predictive models that can analyze and predict winning strategies in TFT.
- To assist game developers in balancing gameplay by providing data-driven insights.
